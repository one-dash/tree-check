This is my way for keeping contents of a USB stick in a proper way in case you
use it on untrusted computers and/or give it to people you do not trust to
monitor which files have changed

These scripts were created for KISS. On any filesystem, it will work. Once you
can't file your tree, hash or signature files, think that your stick got PWND,
you must remove all files from it as all of them were infected, corrupted or
whatever bad people could do to them.

Utils you'll need to run the scripts: bash, find, xargs, fgrep, GnuPG, sha512

Files:
  tree-paths.sh -- common things. You don't need to run this
  tree-write.sh -- script only for writing tree
  tree-check.sh -- check what happened to your tree of files

don't forget to put scripts on your $PATH and chmod them +x
